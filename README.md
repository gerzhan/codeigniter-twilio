==================

twilio library for codeigniter

I wanted to use the new twilio library in codeigniter but couldn't find it.

New Twilio library here: [https://github.com/twilio/twilio-php](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-php)

Demo controller in 'controllers' folder

## Install
Copy the files into the appropriate folders apart from the controller unless you want to try it.
